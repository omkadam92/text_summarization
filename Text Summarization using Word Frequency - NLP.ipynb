    "article_text=\"A litany of text summarization methods have been developed over the last several decades, so answering how text summarization works doesn’t have a single answer. This having been said, these methods can be classified according to their general approaches in addressing the challenge of text summarization. Perhaps the most clear-cut and helpful distinction is that between Extractive and Abstractive text summarization methods. Extractive methods seek to extract the most pertinent information from a text. Extractive text summarization is the more traditional of the two methods, in part because of their relative simplicity compared to abstractive methods. Abstractive methods instead seek to generate a novel body of text that accurately summarizes the original text. Already we can see how this is a more difficult problem - there is a significant degree of freedom in not being limited to simply returning a subset of the original text. This difficulty comes with an upside, though. Despite their relative complexity, Abstractive methods produce much more flexible and arguably faithful summaries, especially in the age of Large Language Models. \""
